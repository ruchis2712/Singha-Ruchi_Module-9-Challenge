# Module 9 Challenge

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he feels there is one piece of information missing: seasonal data. He’s asked you to gather data on the seasons of Oahu and determine whether the seasons could affect the surf and ice cream shop business. Specifically, are there certain times of the year when business might be slower, or the type of customer could be different?

In this challenge, you will be finding a few key aspects of Oahu’s seasonal weather data. The investors want to ensure you’ve hit all of the key points before opening the surf shop.

Coming from the mainland, you know how variable the weather can be in the summer and winter. Your investors want to ensure that there are enough customers between seasons to sustain the business throughout the year.

## Objectives
The goals of this challenge are for you to:
- Determine key statistical data about the month of July
- Determine key statistical data about the month of December
- Compare your findings between the month of July and December
- Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis

### The code file is: climate_analysis.ipynb
### The data file is: hawaii.sqlite

### Analysis observations / findings
On analyzing the data from the months of July and December, we observed that:
- December month is relatively more wet and cooler than the July month
- Dec. max temperature is 83 degree farenheit vs 87 in July
- Dec. min temperature is 56 degree farenheit vs 61 in July
- December month has an average temperature of 71 degree farenheit vs 76 average temperature of July
- December is a wetter month than July


### Additional analysis that should be performed to assess the feasability of the surf and ice cream shop business
- Wind speed should also be analyzed besides precipitation and tempertatures
- Exiting competition should be assessed i.e. how many similar or competing businesses exist in the area and how popular are they
- What is the customer footfall in the area during different times of the year and what is the customer demographics
